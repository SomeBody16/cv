    Hey! I'm a Junior/Mid-developer (honestly, I don't know where
    the border between Junior and Mid is). I prefer own solutions
    than premade because I know 100% of code and if needed I can
    safely modify it, add new feature or debug it if it won't want
    to work. Furthermore, I think I'm ambitious if I have
    opportunity (Ex. Student council, World Championship in
    Microsoft Word Specialist 2013). I like video games, not a 24/7
    gamer, but I would love to create a classic Gwent browser game
    some day, love movies and filmography, true movie creation
    <b>amateur</b> here! I also really like tracking news in javascript
    world, with youtube, reddit, and all kind of news sources - day
    without new framework is a lost day.
